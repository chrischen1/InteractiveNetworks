# InteractiveNetworks
 Web tool for interactive gene network analysis and visualization.
 
Step 1: Prepare your gene expression data in the form of the [example file](https://github.com/chrischen1/InteractiveNetworks/blob/main/networks_test/exp_matrix.txt). Prepare a list of transcirption factors, or gene of your interests as [this example](https://github.com/chrischen1/InteractiveNetworks/blob/main/networks_test/tf_list.txt).

Step 2: Generate the networks from inference algorithms use [network.R](https://github.com/chrischen1/InteractiveNetworks/blob/main/network.R).

Now you are good to go! Run the App with [RStudio](https://shiny.rstudio.com/), and here is an [example](https://chen08900.shinyapps.io/InteractiveNetworks/) published in https://www.shinyapps.io/.
